*Updated October 24th, 2020.*

This page will explain what information is collected through the forkphorus website: https://forkphorus.github.io/ ("the Site").

## What information is collected

### Automatically collected information

A self-hosted instance of Plausible Analytics is used to track website usage. You can see the information collected by this on https://stats.turbowarp.org/forkphorus.github.io. This server stores no personal information.

When loading projects that contain "cloud variables", your IP address, supplied username, and project ID are logged. This information is deleted within 14 days. The data stored in cloud variables is purged within 24 hours of no users being connected to a given project.

## How this information is used

This information is used to monitor usage of the service and prevent abuse. Things like anonymous aggregated statistics may be shared but all personally identifiable information will not be shared.

## Data Retention

All logs are deleted after up to 14 days, unless there are extenuating circumstances that require keeping the logs for a longer period of time (eg. if required by law).

## Third Parties

This privacy policy does not apply to any third party services.

Notably this includes:

 - GitHub, Inc, a subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation, who host the Site.
 - Scratch, who operate the Scratch API used by the Site.
