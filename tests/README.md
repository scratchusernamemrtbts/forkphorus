# Test Suite

Test suite for forkphorus. Automatically runs a few Scratch projects and validates they function correctly.

## Writing Tests

Tests are written as Scratch projects and executed by the compiler.

The easiest way to write a new test is by copying the template file, `sb3/sb3-template.sb3`. You write the behavior you want to test in a `When green flag clicked` block, and you check that they function correctly. For example, you might move a Sprite, then check that the coordinates match what you expect.

The template project provides some custom blocks. The custom blocks `OK` (or `OKAY`) and `FAIL` are treated specially during the tests; their definition is replaced with a special JavaScript implementation during the test (whatever you write in them is ignored and is only a development convenience).

When `FAIL` is used (with an optional message), the project will stop execution and the test is marked as failed. When `OK`/`OKAY` is used (with an optional message), the project will stop execution and the test is marked as passed. Either `OK` or `FAIL` must be executed exactly once.

`assertTrue` is a utility function that calls `FAIL` with a supplied message when the given boolean is false. `assertFalse` is the opposite.

Try to remove all unused costumes and sounds to keep the files small.

### Writing Scratch 2 Tests

The same process as writing Scratch 3 tests (described above), but just save them as .sb2 instead of .sb3. The template file is `sb2/sb2-template.sb2`.

### Writing Scratch 1 Tests

Don't bother, they get converted to Scratch 2. The Scratch 1 test is only there to ensure that the project is converted, not to test anything more complex than that.

### Adding it to the tests

Open tests.js and add the path to your test to `const tests = [...`.
